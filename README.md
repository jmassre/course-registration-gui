# course-registration-gui

This application is a course registration system with a graphical user interface which includes two types of users: the admin and the student. 

The admin menu is where students and courses are created, edited, removed. It's also where an administrator can view reports such as full courses, rosters, specific students' courses, and much more. 
The student menu is where students can register in courses, withdraw from courses, view their registered courses, and view open courses.

Upon the admin and students' every action, the program is then serialized, which allows the information to be stored and used after the program quits running. 

For testing purposes, please login as an admin with the username "Admin" and the password "Admin001". If it is the first time running this program, please make sure to load in course information by clicking the "View all courses" button. After that, you're free to roam around and enjoy this program as you please!

Please use the file "crsgui" to run the program with the graphical user interface. If you'd like to try running this program without graphics and through console, you may do so by running with the file name "Run".

In case you're short on time, here's a quick demo of the Admin menu:
